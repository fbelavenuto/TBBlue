New register system:

(values in Hexa)

243B - Set register #
253B - Set/read value

Registers:
(R)	00 => Machine ID
(R)	01 => Version (Nibble most significant = Major, Nibble less significant = Minor)
(R/W)	02 => Reset:
		bits 7-3 = Reserved, must be 0
		bit 2 = (R) Power-on reset (PoR)
		bit 1 = (R/W) Reading 1 indicates a Hard-reset. If written 1 causes a Hard Reset.
		bit 0 = (R/W) Reading 1 indicates a Soft-reset. If written 1 causes a Soft Reset.
(W)	03 => Set machine type, only in IPL or config mode:
		A write in this register disables the IPL mode (0000 to 3FFF are mapped to the RAM instead of the internal ROM)
		bits 7-5 = Reserved, must be 0
		bits 4-3 = Timing:
			00 or 01 = ZX 48K
			10 = ZX 128K
			11 = ZX +2/+3e
		bit 2 = Reserved, must be 0
		bits 1-0 = Machine type:
			00 = Config mode
			01 = ZX 48K
			10 = ZX 128K
			11 = ZX +2/+3e
(W)	04 => Set page RAM, only in config mode (no IPL):
		bits 7-6 = Reserved, must be 0
		bits 5-0 = RAM page mapped in 0000-3FFF (64 pages of 16K = 1024K, Reset to 0 after a PoR or Hard-reset)
(R/W)	05 => Peripheral 1 setting:
		bits 7-6 = joystick 1 mode (00 = Sinclair, 01 = Kempston, 10 = Cursor)(Reset to 0 after a PoR or Hard-reset)
		bits 5-4 = joystick 2 mode (same as joy1)(Reset to 0 after a PoR or Hard-reset)
		bit 3 = Enable Enhaced ULA (1 = enabled)(Reset to 0 after a PoR or Hard-reset)
		bit 2 = 50/60 Hz mode (0 = 50Hz, 1 = 60Hz)(Reset to 0 after a PoR or Hard-reset)
		bit 1 = Enable Scanlines (1 = enabled)(Reset to 0 after a PoR or Hard-reset)
		bit 0 = Enable Scandoubler (1 = enabled)(Reset to 1 after a PoR or Hard-reset)
(R/W)	06 => Peripheral 2 setting:
		bit 7 = Enable turbo mode (0 = disabled, 1 = enabled)(Reset to 0 after a PoR or Hard-reset)
		bit 6 = DAC chip mode (0 = I2S, 1 = JAP)(Reset to 0 after a PoR or Hard-reset)
		bit 5 = Enable Lightpen  (1 = enabled)(Reset to 0 after a PoR or Hard-reset)
		bit 4 = Enable DivMMC (1 = enabled)(Reset to 0 after a PoR or Hard-reset)
		bit 3 = Enable Multiface (1 = enabled)(Reset to 0 after a PoR or Hard-reset)
		bit 2 = PS/2 mode (0 = keyboard, 1 = mouse)(Reset to 0 after a PoR or Hard-reset)
		bits 1-0 = Audio chip mode (0- = disabled, 10 = YM, 11 = AY)
(R/W)	07 => Turbo mode:
		bit 0 = Turbo (0 = 3.5MHz, 1 = 7MHz)(Reset to 0 after a PoR or Hard-reset)
(R/W)	08 => Peripheral 3 setting:
		bits 7-6 = Reserved, must be 0
		bit 5 = Stereo mode (0 = ABC, 1 = ACB)(Reset to 0 after a PoR or Hard-reset)
		bit 4 = Reserved, must be 0
		bit 3 = Reserved, must be 0
		bit 2 = Enable Timex modes (1 = enabled)(Reset to 0 after a PoR or Hard-reset)
		bit 1 = Enable TurboSound (1 = enabled)(Reset to 0 after a PoR or Hard-reset)
		bit 0 = NTSC/PAL for ZX-Uno (0 = NTSC)(Reset to 0 after a PoR or Hard-reset)

(R)	30 => Raster video line (MSB)
		bits 7-1 = Reserved, always 0
		bit 0 = Raster line MSB (Reset to 0 after a reset)
(R)	31 = Raster video line (lower)
		bits 7-0 = Raster line LSB (0-255)(Reset to 0 after a reset)

(R/W)	34 => Raster line interrupt control
		bit 7 = (R) INT flag, 1=During INT (even if the processor has interrupt disabled)
		bits 6-3 = Reserved, must be 0
		bit 2 = If 1 disables original ULA interrupt
		bit 1 = If 1 enables Raster line interrupt
		bit 0 = MSB of Raster line interrupt value
(R/W)	35 => Raster line interrupt value LSB
		bits 7-0 = Raster line value LSB (0-255)(Reset to 0 after a reset)

(W)	FF => Debug LEDs (DE-1 and DE-2 only)
