Global flag:
243B = # register: 21 is sprites global flags
253B = Read/Write flags:
(R/W)	21 => Sprite system
		bits 7-2 = Reserved, must be 0
		bit 1 = Over border (1 = yes)
		bit 0 = Sprites visible (1 = visible)

Others I/O ports:

Read:
I/O Port 0x303B: Read status flag:
bits: (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, max sprites per line, collision)

Write:
I/O Port 0x303B: Set a sprite index (0-63) (Resets palette address)

I/O port 0x53: Write to the palette (256 bytes).

I/O Port 0x55: Send pattern data. Each sprite has 256 bytes. Address is auto-increment, after 256 bytes the address points to next sprite.

I/O Port 0x57: Send Attribute data. Address is auto-increment, after 4 bytes the address points to next sprite:
  - 1st byte: X position (bits 7-0)
  - 2nd byte: Y position: (0-255)
  - 3rd byte: bits: (4 bits of palette offset, X MSB, mirror X, mirror Y, visible)
  - 4th byte: Name (pattern index, 0-63)
